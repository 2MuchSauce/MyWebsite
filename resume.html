      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3 class="needtime">Interprofessional Agile Project (Public Safety)</h3>
      <p class="timep">Aug 2019 - Dec 2019</p>
      <p>Worked in a team of five students to identify and attempt to solve a real-world problem that exists in the sphere of public safety. The problem that my team identified was package theft in suburban and urban areas and developed a product to help prevent it from happening. The product was a large mailbox for postal workers could easily insert packages into but would require a key to access the packages already inside.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="needtime">Database for a Medical Clinic</h3>
      <p class="timep">Jan 2019 - May 2019</p>
      <p>Developed a database along with an interface that would allow doctors, staff, and patients to do various things such as scheduling appointments and checking their bills. This was done by assigning different roles with different permissions to various people depending on what is expected of them. The database was developed in Postgresql and the interface was developed in Python.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="needtime">Minimal MIPS Disassembler</h3>
      <p class="timep">Jan 2019 - May 2019</p>
      <p>Created a program in C which reads MIPS Assembly instructions from text files in the form of binary strings and converts them into their equivalent text assembler instructions while keeping track of the appropriate memory addresses relevant to each instruction. The program then prints the output in a formatted manner.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="needtime">Traffic Stop Light Simulator</h3>
      <p class="timep">Jan 2018 - May 2018</p>
      <p>Developed a program in Java that can simulate street intersection situations with potential cars in different locations each time. This program determines what the cars should do in each situation along with how the stop light should change colors. This was accomplished with object-oriented programming techniques.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3 class="needtime">Raspberry Pi Sense HAT Mini Games</h3>
      <p class="timep">Aug 2017 - Dec 2017</p>
      <p>Used Python to create a few minigames for a Raspberry Pi Sense HAT which has an 8x8 pixelated screen. This required manually constantly refreshing the screen and learning to use APIâ€™s to use everything to its fullest potential including accelerometers, joysticks, and thermometers.<br><br>
