			<p>Hello! My name is Josef Zaggoti. I was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1999. Ever since I was a child, I've had a passion for seeking knowledge and embracing my curiosity. Computers have helped immensely with accomplishing many tasks that would have otherwise been impossible. This is the reason why I am studying computer science. I simply cannot allow unnecessary limits to exist when accomplishing the things I am curious about. I will continuously learn new ways to accomplish anything I want to do using a computer.</p>
